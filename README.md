### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Welcome to my profile. I am Mirza Akbar Ali. I studied theoretical physics as a bachelor's student at COMSATS University Islamabad and am currently pursuing an Erasmus Mundus Master in Quantum Technologies and Engineering at the University of Bourgogne (France) and Technical University Kaiserslautern (Germany).

I use GitHub to back up various projects and codes I occasionally work on. If you find my repositories useful, you are welcome to fork and use them.
